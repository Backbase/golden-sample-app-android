artifacts on your machine, follow these steps:
1. Log in to [Repo](https://repo.backbase.com) and click your name in the top right.
2. Type in your password to get access to your encrypted password. Copy your encrypted password.
3. Open/create the `gradle.properties` file at `/Users/<username>/.gradle/` (Mac) /
   `C:\Users\<username>\.gradle\` (Windows) / `/home/<username>/.gradle/` (Linux).
4. Add `backbaseRepoUsername=<your username>` to the file.
5. Add `backbaseRepoEncryptedPassword=<your encrypted password>` to the file.
