## Getting started
To get started, please follow this [guide on Backbase.io](https://backbase.io/developers/documentation/mobile-devkit/getting-started/set-up-android-development/).

Note that this project connects to the EBP Sandbox Environment, for that you need to request an API key as [mentioned here](https://backbase.io/developers/documentation/api-sandbox/retail-banking-usa/android-guide/). Add the key to the config.json file in the assets folder.
